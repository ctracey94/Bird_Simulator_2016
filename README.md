***This repository contains two versions of our project, and they give same outputs. However:
    
    BirdSim_Final:
          contains our finalized version of codes for Bird_Simulator_2016, featured with MVC architecture
          
          to run: 
                cd BirdSim_Final/BirdSim
                make  (compile all .java files)
                make new  (create ClickMe.jar which is executable by double click it)
                make run  (run ClickMe.jar in terminal; developers can see a trace for further programming)
    
    updated_src:  -- a primitive version
          contains all classes and an engine (Main.java)
          
          to run: 
                cd updated_src
                make  (compile all .java files)
