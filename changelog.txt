		Updated:
			src/Bird.java
			src/readme

		Created:
			src/Entity.java
			src/Environment.java
			changelog.txt

		Some of the logic of Bird.java (i.e. coordinate position information, and velocity information, as well as the functions used to
		update position) was useful for general purposes, so I moved it to a superclass called Entity.java which can be used to
		create other NPCs or objects besides Bird.

		I also created a small class to hold important Environment variables (i.e. where the bottom-top / left-right edges of the
		map are) so they can be accessed from throughout the engine, and freely updated from 1 place.

		I also created a changelog for us to use to keep track of what changes have already been made.
